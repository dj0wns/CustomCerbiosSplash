# CustomCerbiosSplash
Utility to replace the cerbios splash screen with a mesh generated in blender

# **Warning** #
**This program modifies logic flow in the cerbios bios and could result in a broken bios. DO NOT flash any produced bioses to TSOP unless you have a way to recover. I do not guarantee that this even works on anything other than my personal xbox. I highly recommend testing in Xemu if possible. If this bricks your xbox... sucks lol**
